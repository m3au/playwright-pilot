# Comment Best Practices

## When to Comment

- Explain WHY, not WHAT
- Complex business logic, non-obvious workarounds/hacks
- Document public APIs/interfaces
- Explain architectural decisions

* TODO comments without context

- Comment out code - delete it

## ESLint Disable

- A: include reason when disabling rules
- A: use `eslint-disable-next-line` for specific lines
- N: disable rules globally unless necessary
- N: disable multiple rules in one comment
- A: place disable comments in file where needed, not in config

## Rules

- A: explain non-obvious code with comments
- N: commit commented-out code
- A: prefer self-documenting code over comments
