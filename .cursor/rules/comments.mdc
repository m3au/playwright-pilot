# Comment Best Practices

## When to Comment

- Do explain WHY, not WHAT
- Do explain complex business logic or algorithms
- Do explain non-obvious workarounds or hacks
- Do document public APIs and interfaces
- Do explain architectural decisions

- Don't state the obvious
- Don't repeat what the code clearly shows
- Don't use comments to explain basic syntax
- Don't leave TODO comments without context
- Don't comment out code - delete it

## ESLint Disable Comments

- Always include a reason when disabling rules
- Always use `eslint-disable-next-line` for specific lines
- Never disable rules globally unless necessary
- Never disable multiple rules in one comment
- Always place disable comments in the file where they're needed, not in config

## Code Comments

- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Use `/* */` for multi-line comments only when needed
- Place comments above the code they explain
- Keep comments concise and focused
- Update comments when code changes

## Examples

```typescript
// Use German "kabel" in selector to match actual HTML attribute
const selector = 'a[href*="_kabel.htm"]';

// Workaround: playwright-bdd config requires type assertion due to incompatible types
const config = bddConfig as unknown as Record<string, unknown>;
```

## Rules

- Always remove comments that state the obvious
- Always explain non-obvious code with comments
- Always include context in eslint-disable comments
- Never commit commented-out code
- Never use comments to explain what code does (code should be self-documenting)
- Always update or remove comments when refactoring code
- Always prefer self-documenting code over comments when possible
