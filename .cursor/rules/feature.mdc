# Feature File Standards

## Structure

- Start with `Feature:` followed by a descriptive title
- Include user story format: "As a... I want... So that..."
- Use `Scenario:` for individual test cases
- Use `Scenario Outline:` with `Examples:` for data-driven tests
- Use `@skip` tag for disabled scenarios (prefer commenting them out if long-term disabled)

## Step Definitions

- Always start steps with "I" (e.g., "I navigate", "I click", "I see")
- Never use "should" in step text (e.g., ~~"I should see"~~, use "I see" instead)
- Never use "and" or "or" in the middle of a step description (e.g., ~~"I see popup closed and connector selected"~~)
- Use `Given` for setup/preconditions (e.g., "Given I navigate to the page")
- Use `When` for user actions (e.g., "When I click on button")
- Use `Then` for assertions/outcomes (e.g., "Then I see the result")
- Use `And` keyword only to continue steps of the same type, never in step text
- Keep steps concise and action-oriented
- Each step should verify or perform ONE thing only
- Reference step definitions implemented in POMs via decorators

## Best Practices

- One scenario per specific behavior
- Steps should be reusable across scenarios
- Use descriptive step text that clearly states intent
- Avoid implementation details in step text
- Keep scenarios independent and testable in isolation
- Use tags (`@skip`, etc.) for test organization
