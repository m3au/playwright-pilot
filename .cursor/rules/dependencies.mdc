# Dependency Version Pinning

## Rules

- Always pin exact versions (x.y.z) for all dependencies
- Never use range operators (^, ~, >=, etc.) in package.json
- Always run `node scripts/pin-versions.mjs` after adding new dependencies
- Always verify pinned versions match installed versions
- Never commit unpinned dependency versions

## Rationale

- Ensures reproducible builds across environments
- Prevents unexpected breaking changes from minor/patch updates
- Makes dependency updates explicit and reviewable
- Improves CI/CD reliability

## Tools

- Use `node scripts/pin-versions.mjs` to automatically pin versions
- Use `bun run bump` to update all dependencies to latest versions (then re-pin)
