# Conventional Commits

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

## Scope Examples

Use lowercase, kebab-case: `playwright`, `page-objects`, `config`, `docs`, `tests`

## Examples

See git history for real examples. Common patterns:

```text
feat: add cable selection page object
feat(playwright): implement random product selection
fix(tests): resolve timeout in basket validation

- Increase timeout for notification popup
- Add explicit wait for basket update
```

## Rules

- Always use conventional commits format
- Always use lowercase for type and scope
- Always use imperative mood in subject
- Never end subject with period
- Always explain non-obvious changes in body
- Always reference related issues in footer
- Never commit without a type prefix
- Always commit after meaningful progress - don't accumulate changes
- Always commit by logical units - group related changes together (e.g., all husky hooks, all docs, all configs)
- Always amend commits when making follow-up fixes to the same change (typos, lint errors, formatting)
- Version bumping is automatic: feat = minor, fix = patch, BREAKING CHANGE = major (handled by prepare-commit-msg hook)
- Changelog generation is automatic: CHANGELOG.md is updated automatically on commit
