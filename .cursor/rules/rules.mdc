# Rule File Standards

Cursor rules provide contextual guidance to AI assistants working on the codebase. They must be precise, non-redundant, and token-efficient.

## File Headers

```yaml
---
globs: ['path/pattern/**/*.ts']
description: 'Concise one-line description'
alwaysApply: false
---
```

File organization:

- Single h1 title
- Brief purpose statement
- Reference codebase locations, not inline examples
- Market standards and project-specific guidance
- Actionable checklist

## Content Standards

Each rule must have:

- Single responsibility: One focused topic per file
- Scope: Either project-agnostic (universal best practices) OR project-specific (codebase context)
- No overlaps: Avoid redundancy with other rules
- Minimal tokens: Avoid boilerplate code examples; include reference catalogs (like component lists) when AI needs them

### Glob Patterns

Specify exact file patterns. Examples:

- `tests/e2e/poms/**/*.ts` - POM files
- `tests/e2e/features/**/*.feature` - Feature files
- `**/*.{test,spec}.ts` - Test files

### AlwaysApply Flag

Set `alwaysApply: true` only for:

- Core communication principles (`core.mdc`)
- Universal quality standards (`comments.mdc`, `cspell.mdc`, `dependencies.mdc`, `commits.mdc`)

Never use for domain-specific rules (api, frontend, security, etc.)

## Writing Guidelines

- Point to codebase locations instead of generic examples
- Include reference catalogs (component lists, API catalogs) when AI needs them to choose between options
- Avoid boilerplate: Don't show "how to do it" when examples exist in codebase
- Never reference codebase for obvious patterns (e.g., one-liner if statements, basic ternaries) - only reference for non-obvious or project-specific patterns
- Reference market standards (WCAG, OWASP, framework conventions)
- Sort logically: basics → advanced
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences
- Use lists, not long prose

## Review Checklist

- Verify globs and alwaysApply flag
- Remove boilerplate and link to codebase only for non-obvious patterns
- Ensure single responsibility and no overlaps
- Minimize tokens
