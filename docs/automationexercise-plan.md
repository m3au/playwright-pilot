# AutomationExercise Test Scenarios - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for AutomationExercise test scenarios. AutomationExercise is an e-commerce test automation practice website with comprehensive test cases covering various user interactions.

**Status**: ✅ Phase 2 complete – Authentication scenarios automated

## Test Cases

Based on <https://automationexercise.com/test_cases>, the website provides multiple test scenarios covering:

### User Registration & Authentication

- Register User
- Login User
- Logout User

### Product Browsing & Search

- View Products
- Search Products
- View Product Details
- Add to Cart

### Shopping Cart

- Add Products to Cart
- View Cart
- Update Cart
- Remove from Cart

### Checkout Process

- Place Order
- Payment Integration
- Order Confirmation

### User Account Management

- Update Profile
- View Orders
- Download Invoice

### Contact & Support

- Contact Us Form

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure ✅

1. ✅ Created challenge structure (`tests/e2e/challenges/automationexercise/`)
2. ✅ Created `world.ts` for challenge-specific fixtures
3. ✅ Added challenge to `playwright.config.ts`
4. ✅ Configure `.env` files with AutomationExercise base URL

### Phase 2: User Authentication

- ✅ Register User
- ✅ Login User
- ✅ Logout User

### Phase 3: Product Browsing

- View Products
- Search Products
- View Product Details

### Phase 4: Shopping Cart

- Add Products to Cart
- View Cart
- Update Cart
- Remove from Cart

### Phase 5: Checkout Process

- Place Order
- Payment Integration
- Order Confirmation

### Phase 6: User Account & Support

- Update Profile
- View Orders
- Contact Us Form
- File Upload

## Supporting Utilities & Components

- **Cookie Consent Modal Component**: Handles the `fc-consent` overlay and any residual dialog overlays so navigation links remain clickable.
- **Interstitial Recovery**: Home page fixture now detects and recovers from `google_vignette` ad redirects to keep flows on the AutomationExercise domain.
- **User Provisioning Toolkit**:
  - `generateAutomationExerciseUser()` for deterministic-but-unique fixture data.
  - `registerAutomationExerciseUser()` API client to seed accounts when scenarios need pre-existing users.
  - Context helpers to reuse generated users across steps while avoiding duplicate registrations.
- **Challenge Test Scripts**: `bun run test:automationexercise` runs only this challenge (and still executes the shared `pretest` step). Use `bun run test` to execute all challenges together.

## Base URL Configuration

Update `.env` files with challenge-specific base URLs. Each challenge requires its own `BASE_URL_<CHALLENGE>` variable:

```bash
# In .env or .env.production
BASE_URL_UITESTINGPLAYGROUND=http://uitestingplayground.com
BASE_URL_AUTOMATIONEXERCISE=https://automationexercise.com
TIMEOUT=30000
EXPECT_TIMEOUT=10000
```

**Note**: Challenge-specific base URLs are accessed via `environment(\`BASE*URL*${challengeName.toUpperCase()}\`)!`exported from`@world`. There is no fallback to a global`BASE_URL` - each challenge must have its own variable defined.

## Testing Approach

Each scenario should:

1. Navigate to the specific page
2. Perform the required user interactions
3. Verify the expected outcome
4. Follow Playwright best practices and BDD patterns

## Notes

- All scenarios are independent and can be run in any order
- Follow existing POM patterns from UITestingPlayground challenge
- Use reusable components for common UI elements (header, footer, product cards)
- Follow BDD conventions: Given/When/Then structure with "I" prefix for steps
- Register all POM fixtures in `tests/e2e/challenges/automationexercise/world.ts`
