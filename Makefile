	@echo "  This Makefile provides convenient targets for testing CI/CD workflows"
	@echo "  defined in .github/workflows/ locally using act."
	@echo ""
	@echo "  Use these targets to validate workflow changes before pushing to GitHub,"
	@echo "  debug workflow issues locally, and ensure workflows work correctly in"
	@echo "  your environment before committing changes."
	@echo ""
	@echo "Available targets:"
	@echo ""
	@echo "  make test         - Test E2E tests workflow locally"
	@echo "  make lighthouse   - Test Lighthouse audit workflow locally"
	@echo "  make axe          - Test Axe audit workflow locally"

	@echo "Requirements:"
	@echo "  • Docker must be running (act uses Docker containers to simulate GitHub Actions)"
	@echo "  • act must be installed (brew install act or see https://github.com/nektos/act)"
	@echo "  • .env file with BASE_URL configured (copy .env.example to .env)"
	@echo "  • .actrc file for platform configuration"

	@echo "Tip: Use 'make <target>' to run a specific workflow locally"
	@echo "     Run 'make help' (or simply: make) to see this help again"
	@echo "     Use 'act -l' to list all available workflows"
