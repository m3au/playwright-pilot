# Add commits to ignore in `git blame`. This allows large stylistic refactors to
# avoid mucking up blames.
#
# To configure git to use this, run:
#
#    git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# Add commit hashes below (one per line) for commits that should be ignored in git blame.
# Examples: large formatting changes, major refactors, dependency updates, etc.
